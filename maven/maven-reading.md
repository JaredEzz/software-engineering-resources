#### Update Your Maven Repository
1. Create a new Maven Project in Intellij Idea  
      a. Click “Create new project”  
      b. Select Maven  
      c. Put “com.example” as the groupid and “setup” as the artifact id  
2. Open the settings for your project  
      a. On Mac: Intellij IDEA -> Preferences  
      b. On Windows: File -> Settings  
      
3. Navigate to and update the repository for the following url:  
[https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2) (this will take 10-30min)  
Note: Depending on what version of Intellij you have installed, you may see
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2. If so, update it instead.
